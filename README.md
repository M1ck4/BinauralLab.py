# Binaural Beat Lab

*Real-time binaural-beat generator with live sliders, preset library, and WAV exportâ€”offline & open-source.*

---

## Why use it?

* **Instant feedback.** Hear changes the moment you move a slider.
* **Rich preset library.** Forty hand-tuned programs span Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma ranges.
* **Visual learning.** A live oscilloscope + envelope plot shows exactly how the two tones interact.
* **Custom workflow.** Save, edit, and delete your own combinations; everything lives in a simple JSON file next to the script.
* **Portable audio.** Render any session to a high-quality 44.1 kHz stereo WAV for phone playback or DAW import.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+** (CPython or Anaconda)
* **Headphones** (binaural beats do not work over mono speakers)

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy sounddevice scipy matplotlib
```

`tkinter` ships with the standard Python installer on Windows and most Linux distros; on some minimal Linux images you may need to install it separately:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

---

## Running the Lab

```bash
python BinauralLab.py
```

1. **Pick a preset** from the tree or dial in your own values.
2. Hit **Start** to begin playback; **Stop** halts it.
3. Tweak sliders in real time audio and plot stay in sync.
4. Click **Save** to store the current settings, or **Delete** to remove a saved program.
5. Click **Export** to write a stereo WAV (youâ€™ll be asked for duration and save path).

## File layout

```
BinauralBeatLab/
â”œâ”€ BinauralLab.py          â†’ main application script
â”œâ”€ binaural_presets.json   â†’ auto-generated on first run
â”œâ”€ requirements.txt        â†’ optional, pin versions for CI
â””â”€ docs/
   â””â”€ screenshot.png       â†’ optional images for README
```

`binaural_presets.json` is regenerated with default content the first time you launch the program, then updated whenever you add or delete a preset. Commit this file if you want to share your custom tones.

---

## Building a one-click `.exe` (optional, Windows)

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole BinauralLab.py
# Your standalone binary lives in dist/BinauralLab.exe
```

Ship the EXE by itself; it will create a fresh `binaural_presets.json` on first launch.

## Safety notice

Binaural audio is generally considered safe, but **never** drive, operate machinery, or use at high volume while listening. If you have epilepsy, pacemakers, or other medical concerns, consult a professional first.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to:

* Improve the UI or DSP engine
